Project Name: "Time Locker: 112 Edition"

Project Summary: The project is a top-down shooter on an endless map with an 
interesting time-warping mechanic. The game utilizes a 2D pixel art style. The 
experience is designed to be enjoyed on a computer. The aim of the player is to 
gain the highest score. The player can gain points by moving forward and killing 
enemies. On the game map, there are randomly generated enemies and obstacles. 
There are be a variety of enemies with different of health, move patterns, and 
methods of attack, including special enemies that track the player and follow 
them as well as shoot at them. If these enemies or their projectiles touch the 
player, the player loses. The player controls their characterâ€™s movements using 
the arrow keys. The character only shoots projectiles when it is moving. 
The player can utilize the time-warping mechanic by holding the keys. 
Time slows if the user moves slowly (by tapping the key or holding it for a 
short time), and time will fast forward if the user moves quickly 
(by holding it for a longer period of time). The speed of the flow of time will 
dictate how fast the enemies and projectiles move. If the player is not moving, 
time pauses and everything freezes. However, there is a shadow that starts 
behind the user and moves forward. If the player is caught by this shadow, 
they lose, giving them the incentive to keep moving.

How to run: Simply run the TP.py file (the only python file in folder). Note,
the file accesses images in the Images folder which is in the same folder, so the
user should not modify that folder in any way.

Libraries: N/A

Shortcut commands: 'f' - increase rate enemy and obstacle generation as well as
unlock harder enemies that have not been unlocked (in the case the game is too 
hard and the user never reaches the harder enemies). Note that this command
breaks the scoreLine system since the game assumes the player has progressed 
further in the game then they actually have. Therefore, the player does not gain
points for moving past distances they have already done so.
Other features can all be easily accessed by simply playing the game.
